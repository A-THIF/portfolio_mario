Hi, I'm Mohamed Athif N—a passionate builder who loves turning ideas into reality.

I’m driven by curiosity, energized by building, and inspired when my work empowers others to learn, innovate, and push boundaries. My fascination with technology has always been two-sided.

On one side, I’m the builder—striving to turn ideas into reality. From crafting IoT prototypes like Peripheral Vision to developing Flutter games and AI-powered tools, I get a thrill from architecting systems, solving problems, and adding creative touches that make each project unique. Implementing what I learn in real life gives me a rush that fuels the next challenge.

On the other side, I’m the innovator with precision. I constantly explore new technologies—from Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV to microcontrollers, Raspberry Pi, and embedded systems—ensuring that my creations are not just functional but robust, scalable, and thoughtfully engineered. I embrace constraints, iterate fast, and refine until it works flawlessly.
